# INTRODUCTION

In 2019 I wrote the first version of a workbook for Basics of AL. This time I am back to you with the version for more advanced developers. Now that you have mastered the basics of the AL language and fundamental development concepts, you are ready to dive into more topics that will elevate your skills as Dynamics 365 Business Central developer.
In this advanced workbook, I will guide you through essential aspects of Business Central development, such as working with interfaces, creating queries and APIs, and using lists and dictionaries. You will also learn how to use system modules to enhance the functionality and performance of your applications.

This workbook is designed to be an interactive and practical guide. Just like the basics workbook, this continuation emphasizes writing code yourself. Avoid the temptation to copy-paste. By typing out the code, you will reinforce your learning and improve your coding fluency. Make notes and highlight areas you find challenging. 

The exercises and examples provided are crafted to simulate real-world scenarios, giving you a practical edge in your development projects.

Remember, this workbook is not just a reference guide but a tool to actively work through. Print it out, write in it, and treat it as your development journal. Your engagement will transform theoretical knowledge into practical expertise.

I encourage you to share your experiences and thoughts on social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter. Your feedback on MyNAVBlog.com is also invaluable and helps improve the material for future developers.

This material remains free for you to use and share within your organization. Embrace the journey of becoming an advanced Business Central developer, and let's get started with these exciting new topics!
